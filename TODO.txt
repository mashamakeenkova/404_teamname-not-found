BRAINSORMING: 
persona (example brand) buikd our priduct towards a spcific persona --> add to pitch as a story 
general infos: man, 50, 2 kids, recycles, aware and open minded (or not)
full time working woman (Rachel, Louise, Patricia, Pia, Petra), 42, kids (wants to set a good example for her kids)
"work on your own sustainability"  


new idea: 
Sven , works 40 percent, two girls (8 and 10 years old), loves his job in HR, wants to go to the gym, like zumba and yoga, likes bakiing, 
active in his comunity, parent that goes along on school trips
recources: surface, i phone, not tech savy, has a smartphone and steady internet connection (also on the go)
sustainability: drives his kids to school, drives to work, does not travel for work much, not a vegegtarian (neither are the kids), eats meat for 
the kids, too nice to his kids, spends his wifes money on the kids toys, does the shopping (uses plastic bags, and pet bottles for water), throws gum
out of car window, buys pet bottle every day, learns about climate change issues from his kids (who go to the climate srike), wants to change for the
better and be a good example, print a lot at work, does not recycle pet (or anything frankly), buys take-out a lot, leaves his computer on whrn he 
leaves for meetings, drinks too much cofee (does not use reusabe cups), leaves the lights on, adjusts the themostat for too hot and then opens the 
window, keep yout email inbox clean, realize he has room for improvement, but is missing specific ideas to improve, struggling to build consistent 
and lasting sustainable habbits, lacks something to keep him acountable for this actions

Rachel: gets coffe and a sandwitch wrapped in plastic every day, always stessed, eats meat, buys a lot of food, a lot of electronics (everything is 
plugged in and on standby), shops a lot (many clothes), commute time, gym and indoor cycling fan, uses a lot of post its, prints motivational quotes,
consumes a lot of import products, the app should serve as a sort of self improvement program for Rache, she's very competetive, wants to be in, wants
to be successful 
for the app: 
suggestion box for the employees, everyone can put in ideas, which then get published on the main feed, company uber (coleagues car sharing), cycling
points and public transportations points, enviromental events (bring your own cup teaparty, veggie brunch)
